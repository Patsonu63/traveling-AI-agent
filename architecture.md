# Traveling AI Agent Architecture

## System Architecture Overview

The Traveling AI Agent is designed with a modular architecture following the principles of separation of concerns and high cohesion/low coupling. The system is composed of the following major components:

### Core Components

1. **Agent Core**
   - Central controller managing the overall behavior and lifecycle
   - Coordinates communication between all other components
   - Maintains agent state and context
   - Handles initialization and shutdown procedures

2. **Navigation System**
   - Path planning and route optimization
   - Location tracking and positioning
   - Map representation and management
   - Movement control and execution

3. **Perception Module**
   - Environment sensing and data collection
   - Object and landmark recognition
   - Spatial awareness
   - Environmental condition monitoring

4. **Knowledge Base**
   - Data storage and organization
   - Information retrieval
   - Knowledge representation
   - Memory management

5. **Decision Engine**
   - Goal management
   - Task planning and scheduling
   - Decision-making algorithms
   - Learning and adaptation mechanisms

6. **User Interface**
   - Command interpretation
   - Status reporting and visualization
   - User preference management
   - Interactive controls

7. **Resource Manager**
   - Energy/battery monitoring
   - Computational resource allocation
   - Storage management
   - Performance optimization

## Data Flow

1. The Agent Core initializes all components and establishes communication channels
2. The Perception Module continuously collects data from the environment
3. Collected data is processed and stored in the Knowledge Base
4. The Decision Engine queries the Knowledge Base to make informed decisions
5. Decisions are translated into navigation commands by the Navigation System
6. The User Interface provides status updates and receives user commands
7. The Resource Manager monitors and optimizes resource usage across all components
