- Location awareness and positioning
- Recognition of landmarks and points of interest
- Environmental condition monitoring

### 3. Data Collection and Processing
- Collection of relevant data from the environment
- Data storage and organization
- Data analysis and pattern recognition
- Knowledge extraction from collected data

### 4. Decision Making
- Goal-oriented behavior
- Prioritization of tasks and objectives
- Adaptation to changing conditions
- Learning from past experiences

### 5. User Interaction
